# Image Classification of Cats and Dogs Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs using features extracted from a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model. The project involves the following key steps:

1. **Loading and Preprocessing the Dataset**
2. **Feature Extraction using MobileNetV2**
3. **Dimensionality Reduction using PCA**
4. **Training the SVM Model**
5. **Making Predictions on the Test Dataset**

## Dataset

- **Training Dataset**: Contains images of cats and dogs.
- **Test Dataset**: Contains images of cats and dogs for which predictions need to be made.

## Files

- `train`: Directory containing the training images.
- `test1`: Directory containing the test images.
- `Image Classification of Cats and Dogs Using Support Vector Machine (SVM).py`: Python script for image classification using SVM.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Installation

### Requirements
